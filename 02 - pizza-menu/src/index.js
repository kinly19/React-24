/* Notes
  - <React.StrictMode>
    strict mode is really not a big deal. The only thing that it does is that during development
    it will render all components twice in order to find certain bugs. And also React will check if we're using outdated 
    parts of the React API. Always good to have when developing.

  - React Components
    React applications are entirely made out of components.
    Building blocks of user interface in React'
    Piece of UI that has its own data, logic and appearance (how it works and looks).
    We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them together (Composition).
    Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them.
  
  - JSX
    Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work.
    Components must return a block of JSX
    Extensionn of Javascript that allows us to embed Javascript , CSS and React components into HTML.
    Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call (seen below).

    <header> 
      <h1> style="color: red">
        Hello React!
      </h1>
    </header>

    React.createElement(
      'header',
      null,
      React.createElement(
        'h1',
        {style: {color: 'red'}},
        'Hello React!'
      )
    )

    We could use React without JSX but that would make things really hard to understand.
    JSX is a Declarative approach.
    React is an abstraction away from DOM: We never touch the DOM.

    - Rules for JSX
      JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter 'Javascript mode' by using the {} (for text or attributes).
      We can place Javascript expressions inside {}.
        Eample: reference variables, create arrays or objects, [] .map(), ternary operator.
      Statements are not allowed (if/else, for, switch).
      JSX produces a Javascript expression
      We can pass other pieces of JSX inside {}
      We can write JSX anywhere inside a component(in if/else, assign to variables, pass it into functions).
      A piece of JSX can only have ONE root element. If you need more, use <React.fragment> (or the short <>).


  - Separation of concerns
    Traditional way used one technology per file so you had all your logic within different files, HTML wouldnt make much
    sense without the Javascript file or visa versa.
      HTML, CSS & Javascript
    React one component per file
     JSX(HTML), CSS & Javascript
     Each components UI and logic are all within one place, making it easier to keep track of what logic is used where.
  

  - Styling components
    React doesnt really have a prefered way when it comes to styling components
    We could use inline styles, external CSS, SASS files, CSS modules, Styled components or Tailwind etc.
    Dont use inline styles theyre disgusting as anytenk!.

    - className instead of class (class is a reserved keyword in javascript already).

  - Curly braces
    React's curly braces {} are used within JSX to let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.

  - Props
    Are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree)
    Props only allows us to pass data down from parent to child (one way) and not from child to parent (there are ways to do this "lifting the state up").
    Essentail tool to configure and customize components (like function paramenters).
    Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components.

    - Rules when it comes to props
      Props are read-only, they are immutable!!! this is one of Reacts strict

  - Rendering a list
    https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists
    You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data.
    You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data.

  - Conditional rendering
    https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering
    Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. 
    In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.

  - React fragments
    https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment
    <Fragment>, often used via <>...</> syntax, lets you group elements without a wrapper node (like using a separate div).
