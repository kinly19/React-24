# Notes

## File structure
- Most of our work will be down within the 'src' folder.
- Public folder is where all our assets will go e.g images, svg etc.
- The file structure created for us by CRA (create react app) was done in a way
  React thought was best at the time, This structure can be different depending on
  how you want things done. (It seems react really doesnt mind where or how things are structured within folders)
